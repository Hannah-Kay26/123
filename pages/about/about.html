      <h3>Hi there!</h3>
      <span style="font-weight:700">
        <p>We are Dori, Jessica, and Hannah, and we want to change the way you start your mornings.</p>
      </span>

      <p>We believe a balanced and nutritious breakfast is paramount to starting the day off right, and understand
        the need for a little pick-me-up to help people shake off that morning slump— but instead of chugging a cup of
        coffee for
        that energy boost, why not get it from a delicious cereal?</p>

      <h3>How Buzz Bites Began</h3>
      <p>Our story began in 2024, when we’d finally had enough of our breakfast-less days. Every day, it would be the
        same: wake up to the morning alarm, shower, brush our teeth, get dressed, and get out the door in thirty
        minutes, all so we can start our days on time. In the process, the most important meal of the day would almost
        always
        fall to the wayside: breakfast.</p>

      <p>In lieu of a nutritious and filling breakfast, we had to settle for a quick cup of coffee, hurriedly consumed
        right before we left or during our commute. While the energy was much needed, we wondered if we really had to
        sacrifice adequate nutrition for a caffeine boost. <span style="font-weight: 700;">What if we could get our
          pick-me-up and our breakfast in at
          the same time?</span></p>

      <p>And so, Buzz Bites was born. A delightful blend of honey-toasted oats, multigrain flakes, and clusters of
        roasted nuts and seeds, Buzz Bites promises a satisfying crunch in every spoonful. The cereal is lightly
        sweetened with
        natural sugars and enhanced with a hint of vanilla for a delicious morning treat— and of course, contains the
        equivalent caffeine of a small cup of coffee in every serving, providing a gentle and sustained energy lift. Say
        goodbye to skipping breakfast, and say hello to a more fulfilling morning.</p>
