        <h3>Green Tea Extract </h3>

        <p>This is our main ingredient as this is where our source of caffeine from our cereal comes from. It contains
          50mg of
          caffeine. Green tea extract comes from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant and is highly concentrated.
          It
          contains potent antioxidants–such as flavonoids and polyphenols like epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)–that
          protect against cell damage and offer a variety of health benefits. Some of its health benefits are improved
          alertness, mood, healthier skin, weight loss etc. Our green tea extract is made with all healthy ingredients
          which are meant to improve your health. </p>

        <h3>USDA-Approved Honey</h3>

        <p>Honey is a natural product produced by bees. Honey is not only used as a nutritional product but also as
          medicine
          which is why we decided to make it one of our main ingredients. Our honey is 100% raw and unfiltered which
          means it
          preserves all the natural nutrients, enzymes, and antioxidants that make it beneficial for your health. We
          avoid
          any
          processing methods that could compromise the quality of our honey like heating. Our beekeepers are committed
          to
          providing you with the purest and most delicious honey that we can offer. </p>

        <h3>Non-GMO Oats</h3>

        <p>Our oats are sourced from an organically certified farm that grows non-genetically modified crops without the
          use of pesticides. Our farmers are dedicated to producing healthy food. Oats have several components that are
          good for your health. Oats have a type of soluble fiber called beta-glucan which is known to slow digestion,
          suppress appetite and increase satiety. We also have strict systems in place
          for testing for GMO in our products. To reduce GMO risk, our products are processed in Non-GMO Project
          Verified facilities.</p>
