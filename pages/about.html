    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p class="mission">John Arthur was a beloved professor of philosophy at Binghamton University and director of the Program in Philosophy, Politics and Law from 1988 to 2006. One of John's greatest pleasures was having a friendly debate about philosophical issues over a meal or a cup of coffee.
John Arthur made such a huge impact on our community that after his death we decided we wanted to create a space in memory of him. Thus the idea of John Arthur Cafe was born. We wanted to create a space where people could come together and enjoy food and drinks whilst having a nice chat.</p>
    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <!--<span style="font-weight:700">-->
    <p class="mission">We have a committment to our food as we seek to give people products that taste better than ever and are better for them and the planet.

    That commitment is reflected in every aspect of the guest experience: in our visual 
    design, our restaurant design and across the entire digital experience. At John Arthur Cafe, we strive to create more than just a space for coffee; we aim to foster community, inspire creativity, and provide a sanctuary for connection. Our mission is to craft exceptional beverages and culinary experiences, sourced sustainably and prepared with passion, while nurturing an environment where every guest feels welcomed, valued, and inspired. We are committed to promoting local artisans, supporting ethical practices, and enriching the lives of our customers, one cup at a time.</p>
